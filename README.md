# Atomic exchange

Atomic exchange is a work-in-progress esoteric programming language that has been designed to be easier to program in using pen and paper than by using a text editor.
Thus it is one of very few programming languages that are actually graphical and not just a graphical representation of an existing programming language (aka. Scratch) or a way to represent 2D programs as png files (aka. Piet). 

While not very practical for actual use, it is not very difficult to program in and can possibly serve as inspiration for more practical graphical programming languages (maybe even one for VR?).

It also looks very cool.

## Structure of this repo

The language specification currently resides in `exchange-docs.txt`. 
As for the interpreter, `components.py` contains an implementation of the core language logic and is imported by all of the other python files in this repo. 
The other python files are implementations of basic programs in pure atomic exchange and serve as code examples as well as sort of a standard library of code.
